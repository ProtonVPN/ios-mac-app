# BugReportUI

Report Bug feature UI. Supports both iOS and macOS. 

Minimum iOS version is set to 12, but in reality it will return ViewController only on iOS version 14+. 

For usage example please see `BugReportSampleApp` project.


## Translations

This package contains all translations that it needs. If you add new translation, you should regenerate `LocalizedString.swift` file by going to this libs folder and running swiftgen: `../../Pods/SwiftGen/bin/swiftgen`.


## Assets

This package contains all assets that it needs. If you add new translation, you should regenerate `Assets.swift` file by going to this libs folder and running swiftgen: `../../Pods/SwiftGen/bin/swiftgen`.

Colors contained in the assets are only used for previews but are valid for the app at the time this lib is written. If you ever have to change the colors please provide them to `BugReportCreator`.


## Dependency injection

Everything related to the views (concretely colors) is injected via SwiftUIs environment. Everything related to side effects (like a delegate to get initial data or send back filled report) is injected using `Current` global variable of type `BugReportEnvironment`. Initialy data is set to use mocked `BugReportModel`, but it is set either in `BugReportCreator` or if using `BugReportView` directly from the app, `Current.bugReportDelegate` should be pre-set directly.


## Development

If during development you need SwiftUI previews working, change `Package.swift` file `platforms` iOS value to `.iOS(.v15)` otherwise previews won't work.
