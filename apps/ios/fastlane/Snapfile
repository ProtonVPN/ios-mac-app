### Info for running screenshots manually (not from CI)
# If your screenshots and tests are too slow:
# Uncomment next lines and enter your devided data path, so app is not rebuilt for every device/language pair.
# Before running snapshot, run tests in xcode (with simulator), so the latest code is compiled
# and is present in derived data folder.
