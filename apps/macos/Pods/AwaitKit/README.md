Have you ever dream to write asynchronous code like its synchronous counterpart?

_AwaitKit_ is a powerful Swift library inspired by the [Async/Await specification in ES8 (ECMAScript 2017)](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait) which provides a powerful way to write asynchronous code in a sequential manner.

Internally it uses [PromiseKit](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit) v6.2 to create and manage promises.

</p>

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 8.0+
- Swift 4.0+

## Getting Started

If you want have a quick overview of the project take a look to this [blog post](http://yannickloriot.com/2016/05/awaitkit/).

Put simply, write this:

```swift
let user = try! await(signIn(username: "Foo", password: "Bar"))
try! await(sendWelcomeMailToUser(user))
try! await(redirectToThankYouScreen())

print("All done!")
```

Instead of:

```swift
signIn(username: "Foo", password: "Bar")
  .then { user in
    return self.sendWelcomeMailToUser(user)
  }
  .then { _ in
    return self.redirectToThankYouScreen()
  }
  .then { _ in
    print("All done!")
  }
```

Or worse, using the completion block imbrication hell style:

```swift
signIn(username: "Foo", password: "Bar") { user in
  self.sendWelcomeMailToUser(user) { _ in
    self.redirectToThankYouScreen() { _ in
      print("All done!")
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Async

The `async` method yields the execution to its closure which will run in a background queue and returns a promise which will be resolved at this end of block.

Here a small example :

```swift
func setupNewUser(name: String) -> Promise<User> {  
  return async {
    let newUser = try await(self.createUser(name))
    let friends = try await(self.getFacebookFriends(name))

    newUser.addFriends(friends)

    return newUser
  }
}
```

Here the `setupNewUser` returns a promise with a user as value. If the end of `async` block is executed the promise will be resolved, otherwise if an error occurred inside the async block the promise will be rejected with the corresponding error.

The `async` block will catch the error thrown to reject the promise so you don't need to manage the `await` exceptions. But if necessary, you can:

```swift
async {
  do {
    try await(self.loginOrThrown(username: "yannickl"))
  }
  catch {
    print(error)
  }

  try await(self.clearCache())
}
```

### Await

The `await` method will executes the given promise or block and await until it resolved or failed.

```swift
do {
  let name: String = try await {
    Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 0.2)

    if Int(arc4random_uniform(2) + 1) % 2 == 0 {
      return "yannickl"
    }
    else {
      throw NSError()
    }
  }

  print(name)
}
catch {
  print(error)
}
```

### Custom queues

The `async` and `await` methods runs by default on a background concurrent queue. Of course, you can choose your own queues and call the following methods:

```swift
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .default).ak.async {

}

try DispatchQueue.global(qos: .default).ak.await {

}
```

When you use these methods and you are doing asynchronous, be careful to do nothing in the main thread, otherwise you risk to enter in a deadlock situation.

## Installation

The recommended approach to use _AwaitKit_ in your project is using the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.

### CocoaPods

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```
Go to the directory of your Xcode project, and Create and Edit your Podfile and add _AwaitKit_:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
pod 'AwaitKit', '~> 5.0.1'
```

Install into your project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

If CocoaPods did not find the `PromiseKit 6.0` dependency execute this command:

```bash
$ pod repo update
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

### Swift Package Manager

You can use [The Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager) to install `AwaitKit` by adding the proper description to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/yannickl/AwaitKit.git")
    ]
)
```

Note that the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager) is still in early design and development, for more information checkout its [GitHub Page](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager).

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate AwaitKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "yannickl/AwaitKit" ~> 5.0.1
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `AwaitKit.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Manually

[Download](https://github.com/YannickL/AwaitKit/archive/master.zip) the project and copy the `AwaitKit` folder into your project to use it in. Note that you also need to download the [PromiseKit](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit) v6.2 library and import it to your project.
