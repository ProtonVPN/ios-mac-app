This is a fork of the popular work by [Felix Schulze](https://github.com/x2on), that is a set of scripts for using self-compiled builds of the OpenSSL library on the iPhone and the Apple TV.

However, this repository focuses more on framework-based setups and also adds macOS and watchOS support.

# Compile library

Compile OpenSSL 1.1.1h for all targets:

```
./build-libssl.sh --version=1.1.1h
```

Compile OpenSSL 1.1.1h for specific targets:

```
./build-libssl.sh --version=1.1.1h --targets="ios64-cross-arm64 macos64-x86_64 macos64-arm64"
```

For all options see:

```
./build-libssl.sh --help
```
